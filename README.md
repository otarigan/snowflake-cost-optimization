# Snowflake Cost Optimization

Snowflake contains some tables which allows companies to monitor usage of the data lake. One of the most important initiatives which can reduce redundancies is to track tables which are unused. Without the enterprise edition, it is difficult to fetch this data since there is no access to the ACCESS_HISTORY table. 

This projects gives an alternative of querying such tables and provides other metrics for organizations to monitor their Snowflake usage.
